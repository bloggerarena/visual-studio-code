<h1><span style="font-size:20pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Which Are The Best Visual Studio Code Extensions For Web Development?</span></h1>
<p><br></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Everybody wants to streamline their work flow, and the area of web development is no different. If anything, considering the exponential increase in demand for online content each year, web design and development needs to be not only streamlined, but made as simple and quick as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Best practices for web development often include a fast turnaround on behalf of the client, after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">The world of web development continues to move forward in leaps and bounds as creators and developers bring us new innovations and tools. At the same time, some of these are based on well-established principles and tools that are familiar to developers across the board (JavaScript-centric extensions, is that you I see?).</span></p>
<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Visual Studio Code</span></u></a><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;was conceived of and built to be as frictionless as possible, already giving you a boost as a developer. But the code extensions that come along with it can make the process of development even more seamless.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">What makes for a great VS code extension?</span></p>

<p><br></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Any of these can be valuable features, but the best VS code extensions of all are a combination of all of the above.&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Without further ado, here is a list of some of the top developer-recommended Visual Studio code extensions to make your life as a web developer a little easier.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets"><strong><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">JavaScript (ES6) code snippets</span></u></strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">This tool contains code snippets in ES6 syntax. Code snippets include not only JavaScript but also TypeScript, HTML, Vue, and React.&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Commonly used JavaScript concepts that are included in the snippets are such concepts as loops and functions, as well as others. This tool is a big time-saver for developers, removing the need to manually type out common codes in their entirety. The list of snippets is pretty extensive, guaranteeing the tool&rsquo;s usefulness for any developer. Using the snippets helps to reduce the chance of errors in manually-typed code, too.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server"><strong><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Live Preview/Browser Preview</span></u></strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">These two tools (Live Preview can be downloaded here and Browser Preview can be&nbsp;</span><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=auchenberg.vscode-browser-preview"><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">downloaded here</span></u></a><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;are both designed to allow developers a space within their code editor to review the visuals before executing them. Browser Preview has been previously recommended by developers; currently it&rsquo;s listed as deprecated in favor of Live Preview, which is still under active development, so one or the other may work better for a specific developer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Either way, the ability to view the visuals of your code on-site rather than opening it up in a separate browser can be very useful; especially for web developers who tend to think more in visuals, or those combining web development skills with&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.zilliondesigns.com/users/designers"><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">work as a graphic designer&nbsp;</span></u></a><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">&mdash; these tools are handy to cut down on the time spent toggling from one window to another, and allow the developer to pinpoint code that needs to be adjusted.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag"><strong><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Auto Rename Tag</span></u></strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">This extension is super helpful when writing code, especially when any HTML tags are altered. It automatically changes the other half of the tag, either opening or closing, to match the variation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">If you&rsquo;ve ever had to search through your code looking for the second half of a set of tags, you know how frustrating it can be, especially if you&rsquo;re altering several of them. This is a definite time saver, and frustration-stopper.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag"><strong><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Auto Close Tag</span></u></strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Speaking of tags and frustration, this extension is a major time and keystroke saver. Upon opening a tag, it automatically adds the corresponding close tag and positions the cursor between the two, allowing you to easily add your content and cutting down on the likelihood that you&rsquo;ll forget to put in the closing tag &mdash; or make an error in placing it. As a bonus, this extension performs some of the same features that Auto Rename Tag does &mdash; if you change the opening tag, the closing tag will automatically update to match.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">To make sure all your basics are covered, we definitely recommend both of these extensions. The Auto Close Tag and Auto Rename Tag extensions work extremely well together, and are basic oldies-but-goodies for a web developer&rsquo;s tool kit.</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Better Comments</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">&ldquo;User friendly&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a common commendation for the coding world; without the experience and understanding that goes along with being a professional web developer, lines of code can quickly become overwhelming. But especially when working along with a team, it&rsquo;s important to make sure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to a coding project.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments"><strong><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Better Comments&nbsp;</span></u></strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">This is a great extension for facilitating communication and ease of understanding. It color codes comments based on type and originator, allowing the coding team to more easily follow the direction and insight of the comments.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense"><strong><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Path Intellisense</span></u></strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Small time savers can add up when they are used over and over again. Path Intellisense is designed to autocomplete filenames as you type them. It searches for suggestions, allowing you to pick the one you want without having to type it in every time. No more searching through folders in an extensive project, searching for the name or extension you want and running into the trouble of files being named incorrectly!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=softwaredotcom.swdc-vscode"><strong><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Code Time</span></u></strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">For web developers who need to keep track of their metrics, Code Time is an excellent tool. It runs in the background, meaning that it won&rsquo;t distract you as you&rsquo;re working, but keeps track of keystrokes, lines of code written, and the amount of time you&rsquo;ve spent in the editor, among other factors. It also includes a timer that prompts you to switch tasks or take a break, which can boost productivity and help you to keep your attention where it needs to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">For a professional web developer, understanding your coding habits can go a long way to helping you to see where you need to spend more time &mdash; or less. This extension creates a snapshot-type overview of your working habits, and can also pinpoint areas that may benefit from other extensions to help you further streamline your workflow.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonybaloney.vscode-pets"><strong><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">VS Code Pets</span></u></strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Speaking of boosting productivity, this particular extension is a favorite with many developers, because who doesn&rsquo;t like a mascot? VS Code Pets allows you to put &ldquo;small, bored cat, an enthusiastic dog, a feisty snake, a rubber duck,&rdquo; or even Clippy &mdash; for those of us old enough to remember the notorious C.L.I.P &mdash; into your code editor. The antics of these cute pixelated animals may seem to be more of a distraction than anything, but what&rsquo;s life without a little joy? You can set details like fur color and size, add more mascots whenever you want, and interact with the pets depending on your keystrokes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">The reviews of this extension, unsurprisingly, are enthusiastic. From &ldquo;absolutely adorable,&rdquo; to &ldquo;super enjoyable,&rdquo; to &ldquo;amazing,&rdquo; to &ldquo;the cat found a bug and ate it for me - so proud.&rdquo; VS Code Pets may be the most unusual entry on the list of best Visual Studio Code extensions for web development, but it&rsquo;s also the most crowd-pleasing. Difficult to argue with a cute cat in your code editor!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=c0der-himel.vscode-wev-dev-extension-pack"><strong><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Web Dev extension pack</span></u></strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">As the name suggests, this extension is not one, but many. Designed specifically with web developers in mind, it contains a suite of different extensions that are all ideal for sweetening the web development workflow. There are 36 different extensions in this pack. A few of the individual extensions mentioned on this list &mdash; such as Better Comments and JavaScript Code Snippets &mdash; are included as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">Whether you choose to install this extension pack or not depends on your individual circumstances and needs as a developer. You may decide that opting for a few of the extensions is more optimal for your workflow, rather than spending time playing around with how to make all of them work for you. On the other hand, this extension pack is reportedly extremely useful for beginner developers especially as it gives them insight into just what may be possible with the use of VS Code extensions.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">The continuing story of Visual Studio Code</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">On the VS Code page, the developers notably state tha</span><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/whyvscod"><u><span style="color:#1155cc;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">t VS Code</span></u></a><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;is designed to &ldquo;grow with&rdquo; the developers who use it; individual web developers have individual needs, and VS Code is meant to be customizable to meet those needs. Users are encouraged to figure out the best way to optimize VS Code for themselves and to share their findings with others in the GitHub community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#001e00;background-color:#f5f6f7;font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;">The VS Code extensions listed here are some of the best, but with the spirit of optimization and exploration that fuels the VS Code community, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before ever more tools and extensions join their ranks.&nbsp;</span></p>
